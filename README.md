## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Plain CSS
- Vanilla Javascript
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was an interesting challenge and found the mobile view quite simple however adjusting the elements as the screen increased was slightly difficult however I managed to create thwe web page that looks similar to the design provided. The javascript was not that difficult however I did gain help from a YouTube video regarding the emailFormat variable.

Javascript - email validation: 

```javasript

let emailFormat = /^[^ ]+@[^ ]+\.[a-z]{2,3}$/;

submit.addEventListener("click", () => {
    if (email.value.match(emailFormat)) {
        form.classList.add("valid");
        form.classList.remove("invalid");
    } else {
        form.classList.remove("valid");
        form.classList.add("invalid");
        text.innerHTML = "Please provide a valid email address";
        text.style.padding = "0 0 1.5em 0";
        email.style.border = "1px solid var(--light-red)";
    }
});

```

### Continued development

For future developments, I need to work on using more javascript in future projects. Also, I should begin taking on more challenging responsive projects to test my layout skills.
